                        <strong>var</strong>
                        The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any
                        variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole
                        window.

                        var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available
                        and can be accessed only within that function. <br>
                        <strong>let</strong>
                        A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly
                        braces is a block.

                        So a variable declared in a block with let is only available for use within that block. Let me
                        explain this with an example:

                        <code>
                            let greeting = "say Hi";
                            let times = 4;

                            if (times > 3) {
                                    let hello = "say Hello instead";
                                    console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead"
                                }
                            console.log(hello) // hello is not defined
                        </code>

                        <br>
                        <strong>const</strong>
                        Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some
                        similarities with let declarations.

                        <strong>const declarations are block scoped</strong> const declarations are block scoped
                        Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were
                        declared.

                        Differences Between Arrow and Regular Functions

                        <strong>1. Syntax</strong> <br>

                        The arrow function example above allows a developer to accomplish the same result with fewer
                        lines of code and approximately half the typing. <br>



                        <strong>2. Arguments binding </strong><br>
                        Arrow functions do not have an arguments binding. However, they have access to the arguments
                        object of the closest non-arrow parent function. Named and rest parameters are heavily relied
                        upon to capture the arguments passed to arrow functions. <br>

                        <strong>3. Use of this keyword </strong> <br>
                        Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this. The value of this inside
                        an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound
                        to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function.<br>

                        <strong>4. Using new keyword </strong> <br>
                        Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and
                        callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword.

                        However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can
                        never be used as constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new
                        keyword.<br>

                        <strong>5. No duplicate named parameters</strong> <br>
                        Arrow functions can never have duplicate named parameters, whether in strict or non-strict mode.

                        <strong>When to use forEach?</strong>
                        .forEach() is great you need to execute a function for each individual element in an array. Good
                        practice is that you should use .forEach() when you can’t use other array methods to accomplish
                        your goal. I know this may sound vague, but .forEach() is a generic tool… only use it when you
                        can’t use a more specialized tool.
                        <br>
                        <strong>When to use map? </strong>
                        .map() when you want to transform elements in an array.
                        <br>
                        <strong>When to use filter?</strong>
                        .filter() when you want to select a subset of multiple elements from an array.
                        <br>
                        <strong> When to use find?</strong>
                        .find() When you want to select a single element from an array.
                        <br>
                        <strong>When to use reduce?</strong>
                        .reduce() when you want derive a single value from multiple elements in an array.

                        Template literals are enclosed by backtick (`) characters instead of double or single quotes.

                        Along with having normal strings, template literals can also contain other parts called
                        placeholders, which are embedded expressions delimited by a dollar sign and curly braces:
                        ${expression}. The strings and placeholders get passed to a function — either a default
                        function, or a function you supply. The default function (when you don't supply your own) just
                        performs string interpolation to do substitution of the placeholders and then concatenate the
                        parts into a single string.

                        To supply a function of your own, precede the template literal with a function name; the result
                        is called a tagged template. In that case, the template literal is passed to your tag function,
                        where you can then perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template
                        literal.
